===========
This project expresses a few goals. First of it all, it's an exercise in expressing OO concepts. The manner chosen to express this is an attempt to represent a RDBMS via classes and methods in C#. The database domain is rich enough to provide a variety of potential implementations, and it is familiar enough to remove decision-doubts about my intended output. Secondly, this is intended to serve all GMU members eventually. By progressing through the work this entails, it permits me to focus my time and attention on making decisions on an eventual larger system, by writing code. Specifically, the console-based, Windows-only executable this provides is not very useful. This would be better off written as a webserver application. Essentially this serves as a prototype for a subsequent version, potentially in any of PHP, ASP.NET, Node.JS, or something else.
